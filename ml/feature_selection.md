<h1>Feature Selection</h1>

Feature Selection for development of a machine learning model to predict AB_NICU (Admission to NICU) first step was to exclude all features/variables that cannot be known before delivery of the child such all variables/features reported in "Abnormal Conditions of the Newborn" and "Congenital Anomalies of the Newborn".Second step was to use intuition to exclude features that provided what was considered redundant information. Most Report fields in the dataset tend to be reported in 2 or more fields some basically being groupings of other variables into compund variables(features).

Also more general grouping (ones which consider larger subset of values) was presffered to more verbose values such an example is  PRECARE (Month Prenatal Care Began) was preffered to  PRECARE5 (Reporting Flag for Month Prenatal Care Began) which simply shows the same info only with a breakdown of specific trimester Precare began rather than simply whether precare was attended during pregnancy. This is done simply to first simplyfy model development and should the feature PRECARE and others with a similar relaationship to other features show a high correlation to AB_NICU and be of a higher feature importance then the more spread out version of the variable would be considered in further modeling.
As reported above variable/features reporting similar information albeit in a different angle were also ignored for a generalized variable related to them such an example was PREVIS_REC (Number of Prenatal Visits Recode) ignored in favour of PRECARE.
